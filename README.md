# FuturesTw

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.1.1.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Deployment (Cloudflare Workers)

The app is hosted on Cloudflare Workers using [Static Assets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/). Configuration lives in `wrangler.jsonc`.

```bash
npm run preview   # build + run locally with `wrangler dev`
npm run deploy    # build + `wrangler deploy`
```

First-time local deploys require `npx wrangler login`.

CI/CD is handled by `.github/workflows/deploy-cloudflare.yml`:

- push to `master` → `wrangler deploy` (production)
- pull request → `wrangler versions upload` (preview version URL, no production traffic)

Required GitHub repository secrets:

| Secret | Where to get it |
|--------|-----------------|
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | Cloudflare dashboard → My Profile → API Tokens → template **Edit Cloudflare Workers** |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | Cloudflare dashboard → Workers & Pages → Account ID |

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
